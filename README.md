# Demon Timing

Demon Timing is a roguelike game created by Daniel Pitzele and Dhruv Kapadia. At the time of creation, we were both high school students with little to no formal programming education. All sprites and (almost) all art in the game was drawn by us, and all mechanics/gameplay design aspects were created by us.

## To Play
1. Head [here](https://djpitzele.itch.io/demon-timing) and download the zip file for the game.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Run "Demon Timing.exe" and begin play!

## Basic Controls
WASD - movement keys
Left click - basic attack
Right click - ranged attack
Enter - advance room (if completed)


We used Unity as the game engine, so GitHub only stores the assets folder from the game, which includes the code and art/graphics, both created by us.
